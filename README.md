# MEMDAM (MEMory DAeMon)

## Goal

**Effortlessly** record **all** of your **personal** data in a **simple**, **secure** and **accessible** way to answer questions you care about.

- **Effortless**: No manual data entry required.
  This project is mostly concerned with data that can be collected automatically from other devices and services.
- **All**: It should be possible to use this project to collect any data you care about.
- **Personal**: This project is only concerned with Little Data--the kind of data that is related to a single person.
  If you want to record the price of every stock, or everyone's tweets, use something else.
- **Simple**: Nobody wants life to be complicated.
  Everything that happens to you in real life is an event, so all data is simply a collection of events.
- **Secure**: Only you have access to your data.
  Nothing is ever shared by default.
- **Accessible**: You have complete access to your data, and easy ways to answer the questions you care about.

## Overview

Life is a series of events, so that is how we model it--everything is an [Event](https://github.com/joshalbrecht/memdam/wiki/Event)

This system is responsible for two things:

1. **Recording [Events](https://github.com/joshalbrecht/memdam/wiki/Event).** These are generated by
[Collectors](https://github.com/joshalbrecht/memdam/wiki/Collector) and sent to the [Archive](https://github.com/joshalbrecht/memdam/wiki/Archive),
which is a single, central, encrypted store of all data.

2. **Finding and displaying [Events](https://github.com/joshalbrecht/memdam/wiki/Event)** to answer questions.
[Displays](https://github.com/joshalbrecht/memdam/wiki/Display)
use a simple REST interface to make it possible to answer questions about your data very easily.

## Status

If you are *not* a programmer, [email me](mailto:joshalbrecht@gmail.com) and let me know what you would like to use the project for!

If you *are* a programmer, [take a look at the design](https://github.com/joshalbrecht/memdam/wiki#architecture) and [let me know](mailto:joshalbrecht@gmail.com) what you think of it.

We are currently hard at work on a simple demo for a single type of data (communications, eg, chats, emails, calls, texts, etc)

The documentation on the wiki matches what is planned, not what already exists.
Now there is only a simple client and server.
Integrations with gmail, google hangouts, and google chat are currently in progress.
